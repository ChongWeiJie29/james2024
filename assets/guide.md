✨ Just Another Mobile Evaluation System ✨

## Home Page

Click on "Open Camera" in the landing page. It will bring you to the scanning page 📷.
   - 🚫 An error message will pop up if the servers are down.
   - 🚫 You cannot proceed if the server is down.

## Scanning Phase

Proceed to take pictures of the 6️⃣ different angles of
the phone that you want to check for scratches.

⚠️ Be careful to take each angle within the outline, as cropping will occur 
after taking each picture.

Take note:

- ✔️ You **CAN** retake the same angle twice. The latest picture will be recorded.

- ✔️ You **CAN** take less than 6 angles.

- ❌ You **CANNOT** take a picture of the next angle until the one before it is taken.
Angles that are not allowed to be taken will be grayed out.

After you are done with all the angles, click "Done" on the top right to process the images.
   - ⚠️This process takes a while.

## Interpreting Results

After the images are processed by the server, you will be brought to the results page.
- 🔵 Blue boxes indicate that the AI detects a phone.
- 🔴 Red boxes indicate a scratch.

The results shown are the total number of scratches detected for the respective angle.
Note that the final grade of the phone is still subject to your discretion.

There are 2 buttons available at the bottom of the page:
- ➡️ **Next phone**: Goes to camera for next phone to be processed.
- 🏠: Home page.
